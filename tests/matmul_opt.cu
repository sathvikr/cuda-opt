To optimize the given CUDA matrix multiplication kernel, we focus on improving memory access patterns and leveraging shared memory to reduce global memory accesses. Here's the optimized solution:

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// Optimized matrix multiplication kernel using shared memory and tiling
__global__ void matmulKernel(float* A, float* B, float* C, int N) {
    // Define tile size (TILE x TILE)
    const int TILE = 32;
    __shared__ float sA[TILE][TILE];
    __shared__ float sB[TILE][TILE];

    int bx = blockIdx.x, by = blockIdx.y;
    int tx = threadIdx.x, ty = threadIdx.y;

    // Calculate global row and column indices for this thread
    int row = by * TILE + ty;
    int col = bx * TILE + tx;

    float sum = 0.0f;

    // Loop over tiles of A and B required to compute the C element
    for (int m = 0; m < (N + TILE - 1) / TILE; ++m) {
        // Load tile from A into shared memory
        int aCol = m * TILE + tx;
        if (aCol < N && row < N) {
            sA[ty][tx] = A[row * N + aCol];
        } else {
            sA[ty][tx] = 0.0f;
        }

        // Load tile from B into shared memory
        int bRow = m * TILE + ty;
        if (bRow < N && col < N) {
            sB[ty][tx] = B[bRow * N + col];
        } else {
            sB[ty][tx] = 0.0f;
        }

        // Synchronize to ensure all tiles are loaded
        __syncthreads();

        // Compute the partial sum for the current tile
        #pragma unroll
        for (int k = 0; k < TILE; ++k) {
            sum += sA[ty][k] * sB[k][tx];
        }

        // Synchronize to prevent data races before next tile
        __syncthreads();
    }

    // Write the computed result to global memory
    if (row < N && col < N) {
        C[row * N + col] = sum;
    }
}

// Host function to launch the optimized kernel
void matmul(float* A, float* B, float* C, int N) {
    // Use 32x32 threads per block
    dim3 blockDim(32, 32);
    dim3 gridDim((N + blockDim.x - 1) / blockDim.x, 
                 (N + blockDim.y - 1) / blockDim.y);

    // Launch the optimized kernel
    matmulKernel<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>(A, B, C, N);
}
```

**Key Optimizations:**

1. **Tiling with Shared Memory:** 
   - Use 32x32 tiles to reduce global memory accesses. Each block loads a tile from A and B into shared memory, allowing data reuse across multiple threads.

2. **Coalesced Memory Access:**
   - Global memory accesses are structured to ensure consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses, maximizing memory bandwidth utilization.

3. **Edge Handling:**
   - Conditionally load elements within matrix boundaries, padding out-of-bound accesses with zeros to handle cases where matrix dimensions aren't multiples of the tile size.

4. **Loop Unrolling:**
   - The inner loop over tile elements is unrolled (`#pragma unroll`) to reduce loop overhead and improve instruction throughput.

5. **Larger Block Size:**
   - Increased block size to 32x32 threads, improving occupancy and allowing more threads to execute concurrently on each SM.

6. **Bank Conflict Avoidance:**
   - Shared memory access patterns are optimized to minimize bank conflicts, leveraging hardware support for broadcast operations.

**Host Function Changes:**
- The block dimensions are set to 32x32 to match the tile size used in the kernel, ensuring each thread block processes a 32x32 tile of the output matrix.

This optimized approach significantly reduces global memory traffic and improves computational efficiency, leading to better performance especially for large matrices.
